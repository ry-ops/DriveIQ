| Maintenance Item | Status | Recommended Interval | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Engine Oil & Filter | Excellent | Every 5–10k mi | Consistently performed; continue every 5k |
| Tire Rotation / Alignment | Good | Every 5k mi / as needed | Regular service and recent alignment |
| Engine Air Filter | Late | Every 30k mi | First replaced at 74k; due again soon |
| Cabin Air Filter | OK | Every 30k mi | Replaced at 74k; due around 105k |
| Spark Plugs | Overdue | 100k mi | Not yet replaced; should be done ASAP |
